What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I would definitely recommend that people taking this class in the future go to office hours, TA hours, etc. And don't be afraid to talk to other students in class or in office hours. Don't try to figure everything out alone, especially if you're fairly new to coding/computer science. 
    
    Things that worked were paying attention in class (and then referring back to my notes, both from 120 and CSC 110 last semester), going to office hours, and bouncing ideas off other students. I liked starting with the pseudocode of ideas to just lay out everything that I needed to do ahead of time. I put this in the comments and then put my actual code next to the comments when it came time.

    Things that didn't work mostly revolved around continued confusion. I was (and still am a little) confused about what exactly a constructor is. When I hit a wall, it didn't help to just keep staring at it. Instead, Google, friends, other students, TAs, or professors are extremely valuable resources.
